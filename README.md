# Project Name

The assigment: Build a chatbot with Javascript. Project was done in pairs using pairprogramming.

## The problem

We had some issues with connecting the functions in jacascript and making the chat run smoothly. If  we we would redo it we would use a seperat function to push forward the questions and answers, but for this version we solved it by coding one function at the time where each function evokes the next one.
